## Web interface (Dispatcher View) for the emergency vehicle tracking app - a capstone project for Ateneo de Davao University

This interface allows dispatchers to take in tickets (emergencies) from different users using the mobile app and assign a vehicle per station to that emergency.

The interface allows the dispatcher to see the name, the emergency, and location of the person.

# TO DEVELOPERS
